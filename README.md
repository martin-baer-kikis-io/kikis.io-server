# kikis.io-server
Windows side of kikis.io

This repos is bit of a mess.   It was moved to github Aug 2023.  Plenty of extrainious files
and directories-will get a good cleaning at some point.

Find the build in ./SRC/CmakeLists.txt

and ./SRC/kikis-cpp.sln

Any other README is years out of date and can
be safely ignored.
